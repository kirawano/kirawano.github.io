    <h1 id = 'titleText' style = 'color:cyan;'>[Noun]pilled [Noun but more generalized]maxxer: an excuse to work with Google Gemini's API for the first time</h1>

    <i>short one today, just wanted to put something out there so I can commit these hundreds of little changes</i>

    <p>Alright, so I've noticed a somewhat false trend among my friends: we like to say something like "Xpilled Ymaxxer," and it doesn't really mean anything except the fact that we're partaking in said subject. What's happening is that X is any noun, and Y is a more general form of that noun (producedpilled foodmaxxer, etc).</p>

    <p>So what I'm going to do is use the Gemini API to ask for a more general form of a noun inputted, and then give you an answer in the form of "Xpilled f(X)maxxer".</p>

    <h2 style="color:cyan;">Gemini API</h2>
    <p>I've never actually interacted with the Gemini API before, so the first order of business is to create a key and figure out how to request the LLM to give you an output.</p>

	<p>I decided to do it in python, and I don't think I'll make this an integrated web app just yet because github pages isn't built for that kind of thing. You might see it later though when I get this onto a real server</p>

	<p>Ok, that didn't take very long, most of the time was spent getting a key. I've just turned it into a bash alias that will give you a prompt for now.</p>

	<p>Here's the final product!</p>
